# Preface

This is a small app for my son. Since he has been born it has been a running joke about when he is being good he is earning Ice cream points. So I wanted to make an app to track these points. 

Now he is getting older he is also losing points for being naughty! 

This also gives me a playground to play about with the more recent language, library and SDK changes in Swift / SwiftUI / iOS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to this I wanted to try out a bunch of Architectures with the latest SwiftUI changes including navigation. This project is done as a ViperC Architected project. Though I know isn't recommended by Apple and sometimes frowned upon, I wanted to see how well it would fair in a more modern SwifTUI world for a bit of fun.
